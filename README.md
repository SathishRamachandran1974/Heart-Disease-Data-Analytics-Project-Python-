## ❤️Heart Disease Data Analytics Project (Python)  
   - This project applies Python-based data analytics to a clinical dataset of 918 patients to uncover key health risk factors and patterns associated with heart disease.
     Using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, the project cleans, processes, and visualizes patient health metrics to derive actionable medical insights.

## Objective
   - The goal of this project is to analyze patient data across demographics, clinical features, and test results to identify factors correlated with heart disease.
     By combining statistical summaries with visualizations, the project highlights which patient attributes (age, cholesterol, blood pressure, etc.) have the
     strongest association with cardiac risk.
   - Key KPIs such as prevalence rates, cholesterol distribution, and risk ratios provide a quick overview, while categorical and numerical analyses allow deeper
     exploration of patient subgroups.

## Key ProjectGoals 
   - Analyze patient demographics and identify high-risk groups by age and sex.
   - Evaluate the impact of cholesterol, blood pressure, and blood sugar on heart disease risk.
   - Compare heart disease prevalence across chest pain types, ECG results, and exercise-induced angina.
   - Provide summary tables and visualizations for quick interpretation of medical patterns.
   - Build reproducible analytics using Python for healthcare research and reporting.

## Analysis Features
   - Data Cleaning – Removed duplicates, handled missing values, and ensured data quality.
   - Key Metrics Overview – Heart disease prevalence, age distribution, cholesterol categories.
   - Age Distribution – Histogram of patients across age groups.
   - Gender vs Heart Disease – Stacked bar chart comparing prevalence by sex.
   - Chest Pain Analysis – Visualization of heart disease distribution across chest pain types.
   - Cholesterol Levels – Categorized into Low, Normal, High; ~58% of high-cholesterol patients had heart disease.
   - Blood Pressure Categories – Donut chart showing risk by Low, Normal, and High BP.
   - Fasting Blood Sugar – Normal vs High sugar level distributions.
   - Resting ECG & Max Heart Rate – Associations with disease risk.
   - Exercise-Induced Angina – Proportion of patients experiencing angina during exercise.
   - Chest Pain vs Disease Table – Summary of counts and prevalence by pain type.

## Key Findings (from the Analysis)
   - Age & Gender: Middle-aged males had higher prevalence compared to females. 
   - Cholesterol: 58% of patients with high cholesterol were diagnosed with heart disease.
   - Blood Pressure: Patients with high BP showed a 58.4% prevalence rate.
   - Chest Pain: Asymptomatic (ASY) patients had the highest number of heart disease cases.
   - ercise-Induced Angina: Patients with angina during exercise were significantly more likely to have heart disease.
   - Overall Prevalence: Around half of the dataset population showed indicators of heart disease.
